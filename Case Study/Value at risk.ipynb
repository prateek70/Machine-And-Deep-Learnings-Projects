    "Case Study - Value at Risk\n",
    "One of the popular terms in fianace is VaR (Value at Risk). VaR does not mean variance. In the 1980s, J.P. Morgan introduced the term VaR to answer the questions of the investors: \"How much might I loose?\". VaR uses probability models to rule out 5% worst case scenario over a time horizon for example next year. Using VaR, a financial company can determine that an asset has a 3% on-month VaR of 2%. This means that there are 3% chances that the asset will decline the value by 2% in one-month time frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are assisting a fund manager. Your manager manages the $1 million portfolio of a wealthy investor. You expect the portfolio to grow 10% over the next year with standard deviation of 30%. You have to assist the fund manager in determining the risk of owning this investment in simple language using VaR that excludes the worst 5% of the scenario.\n",
